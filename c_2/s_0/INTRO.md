# Software & development tools installing

To facilitates the deployment of applications on the robot, the development process is performed directly on the Jetson board in a remote faction.
To that end, a set of software and tools need to be installed on the Jetson:
1.  ROS 2 middle ware + the build environment necessary to develop and build a ROS based application (in C++ or Python)
2. The [Arduino CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) toolset for Arduino based sketch compilation, dependencies manager, firmware deployment
3. Different Remote development environment setups on the robot

These steps will be detailed on each sub-section.
